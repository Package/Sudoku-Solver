# Sudoku Solver

This is a Sudoku Solver with a graphical interface. It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate a solution to the puzzle.

You can customize the puzzle input through the GUI, or use one of the preset puzzles. 

It has intentional delay so you can visualise the backtracking algorithm better. Without any delay it would solve puzzles instantly.
